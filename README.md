* ```Fireball_Scraper.py```: Scrapes fireball impact data from the American Meteor Society and stores as a serialized dictionary
* ```Fireball_to_CSV.py```: Loads serialized fireball data and converts to CSV format. Some events have no locational impact data so it removes those and prints how many were removed.
