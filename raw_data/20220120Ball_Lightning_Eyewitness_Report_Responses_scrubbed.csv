After reading a fine article in The New Scientist page 46 - 24 October. Great Balls of Fire.
I remember well an experience I had at 10 years of aged in January about 1956. I was on holiday in a beach house just out of Christchurch New Zealand.
The day was very hot and very low humidity, the house was on a dusty shingle road that  curved around past the house, We were outside at the gate when  there was a dry lightning strike to the ground that occurred about 500 meters to 1 km up the road. We did not see the impact point. Scared the bejesus out of us.
What seemed some time later but probably less than a minute this amazing apparition travelled at probably about 10 k along the road from the area of the lightning strike past us and continued around the curve in the center of the dry shingle road and disappeared from view.
It was like an animated cartoon of many lightning bolts all forming triangles as a mass and travelling (crackling)  just above the road, probably about 1 meter in diameter. Once past we smelt what I now know to be ozone.
Not what I would suggest Ball Lightning. But amazing.
I later worked as a (CRT) TV serviceman and played with high voltages and the smell of ozone.

Late one autumn afternoon in 1971, I was a sergeant technician in the Royal Corps of Signals and part of a team installing a new PABX (Private Automatic Branch telephone Exchange) in a small room inside one of the ‘golf balls’ (radomes) at RAF Troodos on a mountain top in Cyprus. The PABX room had breeze-block walls (without any windows), painted and sealed to minimise dust and damp. The cement floor was covered by thermoplastic antistatic tiles. No noticeable draughts were coming through the closed and draught-proofed door, or from the water-proofed, 1.5m deep, cable pit (even though its covers were off at the time). The PABX was only partly installed, so it was not powered up. The only ‘live’ power in the room was for lighting and mains outlets.

Several armoured, metal-sheathed, ducted, underground external cables entered via the cable pit and were terminated on blocks on the line side of the earthed MDF (Main cable Distribution Frame). Plastic-sheathed internal cables, many already terminated, ran from blocks on the exchange side of the MDF, via overhead ladder-racking, to the PABX racks on which switching equipment would be hung later. As yet, there were no jumper wires on the MDF connecting its line side to the exchange side, so the external cables were isolated from the equipment racks. Every circuit on the MDF had a fuse and a lightning protector fitted.

I was alone in the PABX, between two racks with the MDF on my left, terminating cables. A thunderstorm had ended an hour or so earlier and the room was quiet. I suddenly heard hissing, humming, buzzing and crackling noises on my left, which sounded like the noises often heard around H.T. electricity grid pylons and overhead cables during rain.

I looked left and saw a spherical, very bright, bluish-white light with fuzzy edges, roughly 30cm in diameter, rising slowly from the nearest corner of the cable pit. It looked like a ball of intense pure energy, rather than a solid object, that seemed to be ‘climbing’ up the left hand side of the first MDF vertical.

By the time it had reached roughly 2m above floor level, it had come into contact with each of the four termination blocks on that vertical in turn and loudly blown every fuse and lightning protector on them. It had also shrunk to roughly half its original size, stopped making noises, reduced its brightness and turned a more orange colour (as if it had dissipated some of its energy blowing the fuses and lightning protectors).

Then it slowly floated downwards and slightly towards me to hover silently for a few seconds, roughly 10cm above the floor tiles next to the nearest corner of the cable pit. It then floated horizontally for roughly 20 seconds, at a constant speed, still silently and maintaining this height above the floor, in a smooth curve between the MDF and the equipment racks. It passed only about 2.5m from me. I then moved out from my position between the racks to watch it as it floated towards the north wall of the room. When it reached that wall, it vanished without a sound, leaving no marks on the wall. It was as if it had either passed though the wall, or dissipated the rest of its energy into it. The whole event only lasted for about a minute.

I was an evacuee from London to a village Newton Longville (near Bletchley) Bucks. Every year in summer the local manor would give a garden party for the village children, when in 1942 at the party I decided to leave to go across the road to the village shop to purchase a ice cream, returning from the shop it started raining heavily so I sheltered in the only telephone box. When after a short time there was a flash of lightning accompanied instantly by a very loud bang, just outside the box appeared a bright orange ball slightly smaller than a tennis ball that appeared to me as a roman candle which hovered at about 3 or 4 inches above the tarmac path then slowly drifted down this slightly sloping path fizzling in the rain when about 20 yards away it just faded out.
I can’t recall mentioning this phenomenon to anyone as I could not explain the experience with the limited vocabulary I had at the time. Later in life when recalling this memory I felt I was very fortunate as the cast iron telephone box could have acted as a Faraday cage protecting me from the lightning.

In May of this year, we had a thunderstorm, just a normal everyday storm.  However, I happened to be watching the lightning strikes through the window when one strike flashed several times in the same spot.  However, after these repeated flashes and in the same column, there remained a faint pinky-red glow which persisted long enough, initially for me to notice and secondly for me to grab my phone and take two photos of it.

This residual glow, whilst vaguely perceptible on the photo, did not show up as clearly as it did to the eye, but that's maybe not surprising as the glow was fading all the time whilst I grabbed my phone.  Ultimately I thought that such a faint image on the photos would not interest anyone and so I'm afraid I deleted the photos.

11/14/2020 15:06:09,No,Sonnenfeld verified that this is purely synthetic.,I did not personally witness,A very pretty (but fake) video is here:,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwR14D3NA8c,,"I saw a video of ball lighting on TikTok which appeared real.  I showed it to a patient that is a licensed electrician and he described seeing this a number of times at a cabin in Colorado somewhere close to Colorado Springs.  He said the conditions there are often prime for the phenomenon.  The area is in Colorado and west of Garden City, Kansas.  The soil there is very rocky and conditions are often very dry.  I think the area is at 4-5,000 feet elevation.
He explained that normally these bursts of electrical energy will immediately be grounded but with the dry, rocky soil and the right environment these balls will form and appear to float a bit before discharging into the ground.  He seemed to know a great deal about Tesla’s work and thought he could create the balls in the correct environment.  He said that electrified air was the basis of his apparatus that could send out “waves” of electricity to wirelessly illuminate light bulbs.
In the video the ball is seen going over railroad tracks.  He was surprised the balls would go over railroad tracks but thought it would be a section of track carrying current to run switching mechanisms so there would be a repelling charge like the induction we use for wireless charging devices.  
I can try to put you in touch with this gentleman if interested.  If you would like the video I can email it to you.",,,,,,You may publish my anonymized report,,,,,,

There was a truck with a crane and someone standing in the basket at the height of the top of the pylon, where the wires were hung. My attention was drawn by a very bright, white spherical ball, which seemed to be hovering close to (or even around) the top of the pylon, about 2-3m away from the engineer. From 200 yards away it appeared to be uniformly spherical. I don’t recall how sharply it’s edges were defined but it did appear to be spherical. It moved slightly, sideways by less than its diameter before vanishing.

I cycled past, expecting there to be a commotion and, perhaps, an injured engineer. But no-one appeared to be hurt and either the workers were speechless at the apparition or were used to experiencing such phenomena.

It stayed a constant size, shape and color throughout.",I was inside a vehicle (windows very slightly open) and did not notice any smell or change in temperature. It was perfectly silent. I remember noting an absence of sound in the area (no insects or birds) during the encounter.,"I saw ball lightning for the one and only time when I was about 8 years old, in 1990 or 1991. This was on the outskirts of Tucson, AZ near the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains. It was about 8 or 9 pm at night, and we were driving back to my grandmother’s house. The weather had been cloudy and overcast all day, as happens when the remnants of a hurricane or tropical storm moves in from the gulf. It might have rained earlier in the day, but it was not raining or storming at the time.
As we pulled into the driveway and parked, a giant red ball emerged from the cloud cover in front of us. It was red and seemed to be covered in flames. (With the perspective of an adult, I think we were too far away to see any normal looking flames, and the ripples on the surface might have been more like some kind of electrical fire or disturbance. It looked almost exactly like how medieval woodcuts depict fireballs or comets, though I had not seen these kinds of pictures at that age).
The ball was perfectly round, monochromatic red, and lit the entire desert around us red as well. It emerged from the clouds without disturbing them, dipped down and over, and then went back up into the clouds, exactly like a giant yo-yo with a slight sideways trajectory. It lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. The whole episode was silent, and the desert was eerily quite for the entire time, without the usual bird or insect noises.
Although I remember the episode very clearly, I never spoke of it, and for years I sometimes even wondered if I dreamed it. One day about a decade after the event, my mother (who was driving the car that night) mentioned that she had once seen a UFO, and described the events almost exactly as I remember them! I have since concluded that ball lightning is the most likely explanation for what I saw. 
","There was light, even cloud cover from horizon to horizon. It had been cloudy all day. This weather pattern happen sometimes in the Tucson area when a hurricane or tropical storm moves in from the gulf, but has no real storm energy left when it crosses the Sonoran Desert. It was not storming at the time, and I don't recall any thunder or lightning that day.","This occurred outdoors. We lived at the edge of Tucson near the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The ball emerged over the desert, between our house and the mountains, which was almost completely undeveloped at the time, with no tall structures or power lines. There might have been an elementary school in the general direction of the ball, but I don't recall exactly where the school was.","Late summer or fall of 1990 or 1991, 8 or 9pm.",,"Near the foothills of the Catalina Mountains, between the mounatins and the city, northeast of Tucson, AZ.

It was approximately the size of a tennis ball, maybe a bit smaller.","I believe it made a hissing, sizzling noise.","We were in a kitchen, which had a disused but open fireplace adjacent to an aluminum-trim table and an open door leading to an outside porch. A lighting arrestor cable was run down the chimney and bolted to a steel pipe driven through the ground under the fireplace. The table was an old 1940’s four seat Formica table with wide aluminum grooved siding (about the width of a palm) extending down from the table top.There was a very close lightning hit and everyone was startled, stopped talking and then laughed. As we did that, a hissing green ball descended the lightning arrestor cable (about 3 feet of it was in view), hopped over to the aluminum table edging (about 3-4 feet), circled the table counter-clockwise 3/4 of a circuit until it was opposite the screen door about 6 feet from the table. It left the table trim and traveled in a downward arc from the table height to about knee level, where it passed through the door screen (steel, I think, but maybe vinyl). It bounced once or twice as it moved off the painted concrete porch, then popped out of existence with a flash but without sound. The entire interior part of the encounter took about 3 seconds, enough time for the people in the room to freeze but not enough time to react before it was gone. I recall that it melted about a one-inch hole in the screen in the door, but left no marks on anything else.It was green with a very bright center and fuzzy edges that fluctuated like a three dimensional oscilloscope trace.","This was in mid-late June in a rural area of Maryland around 1970 or 1971. There was a thunderstorm with lighting striking very near the house going on. The temperature was quite warm so we had some doors open to move the air a bit.

","It was summer, probably near my birthday as my father has a similar one and we celebrated together. Lots of family were in the house and it was crowded. That puts it in mid-late June.

We have a window to the left that is almost from the ground to the roof, There is a glass cabinet that contains a TV , on the left side besides the window there are electric sockets. While i dont think this got any of it to do but there is 230V coming out of this, out of the window approx 70-100m there is electric lines, when i go back to my child eyes there could be a transformer up in the electric pole, While not 100% sure of this as well i need to check if this also is necessary information(probably Could be).

While there is a cold outside rain coming from time to time and lightning going off now and then,
we got this super Mario 64 and we were so eager to play this that we did not care if there was lightning. So as a child I just asked until it was okay to play. We were maybe playing 1-2hours until bedtime and i little more i bet the clock was around 8-9. So while we were sitting there, A weird  light got my attention away from my focus area, so I turned. it looked kinda like something was wielding on the line, but something was starting to be created around where the electric line was, i saw it move in a linear way, coming towards the house. And there it was, it was moving through the wall maybe 40cm from the floor beside the electric socket. I could now begin to see the tip of it. Realising the ball with shape approx 30cm, with a kinda fluff around it as it came through the wall, it was like a blend electrode welding colour, blue,purple ish. As I'm just in disbelief and having no clue what is going on I'm just sitting there staring at it as it flies in a linear way taking a 90¤ bend behind the glass cabinet. Now the light behind the cabin gives of a little blend strobe, not dimming and the colour slightly changes, and the glass cabinet implodes, as i was sitting right next to it i didn't even get any glass on me (as i was not cleaning it up i could also if necessary check who was cleaning it if there was a lot of glass in the cabinet.). It then took up some speed moving behind the cabinet and wall and went through the wall again, and to never be seen again.

I still feel it was there for 30min, but my wildest guess from when it was formed outside to when it came visiting and blowing up the cabinet. 1-2 min ",I guess 1997-8 around desember,,"Jørpeland, Norway ",Show it to me before your publish it.,,,,,,

I was in my apartment (Carmel Apartments) on the second floor that faced East when to my stunned observation this spinning round white bolt came silently through the closed Eastern sliding glass door. The rooms were in the shape of a “T”. The living room/dining room were bound by sliding glass doors on each side. The shortened upright of the “T” led to the front door with a window beside it. This phenomenon appeared suddenly inside. I did not see its approach. Upon observation I ascertained it as some sort of ungrounded lightening, so being afraid of being the conduit to it being grounded I backed up and flattened against the wall. I expected the ball to continue through to the dining room sliding door to exit but it seemed to be drawn towards me(which was frightening). It moved steadily toward me making its interior path an “L” instead of the straight line I expected and exited after passing very close but not touching in front of me at chest height. I didn’t feel it passing. Keeping its form, it passed through the closed front door South facing window. I was too stunned to watch it further.
     The apartment house was about 75 feet west from a utility pole upon which hung a (?) transformer box. My kids and I often observed “lightening” dancing along the wires during a storm. I thought this lightening had “escaped” from the wire.
     We lived about 1 mile East of large inlets of the Gulf of Mexico and 1/2 mile South of the Manatee River.
     It left no evidence, burning smell or damage...just a stunned and frightened observer.

I lived in Clawson a suburb of Detroit on the west side. I remember talk of the The ""Twelve Town Drains"" being built at that time. It was very hot, (it may have been summer). I was board and setting in my room on the second story of our home looking out at the loudest and heaviest rain I had ever seen. I don't remember lightening, just a serious downpour of water. I saw something bright like the sun a little smaller than a basket ball fall from the branches of the front yard tree onto a branch that I used to dangle from. It was about 5 to 8 yards from the front of our house, (city houses close to the road, the tree was against the sidewalk at the end of our lawn). This ball rolled a couple inches down the branch and another the same size fell in behind the other. The balls never touched. They were slightly jiggly like a burning candle flame when it flicks from a breeze. The first ball rolled down the side of the tree trunk onto the road and the second rolled in its place but before it left the branch a small sun smaller than a tennis ball bounced from the limbs of the tree onto the same branch. ( I cannot say what kind of tree or if there were scorch marks anywhere. I don't remember looking and no one ever said). The small sun was very bouncy (up and down, not side to side) like a child vs an adult. The second sun rolled to the road. the two large suns were rolling down the edge of our fairly newly paved (from dirt to concrete) road where most of the water was concentrated. I remember looking back from the small to the large suns a few times when finally the small sun bounced to the ground and followed the larger two. All three suns, the larger two rolling smoothly and the smaller a little bouncy rolled out of sight down the street as far as I could see from my upstairs window. This could not have lasted more than 10 seconds total. From my upstairs view I could only see the tree trunk and the lowest branches of the tree. I knew no one would ever believe me.

It was an excellent vantage point that was often up close and personal with the frequent Iowa thunderstorms. One particular storm had my full attention: there were many lighting strikes to earth, with unusually frequent multiple flashes along the same path.  What riveted my attention was the presence of what appeared to be twin balls on either side of some of the bolts, recurring about every 40 feet along its length.  It's possible these pairs were actually a single toroid around the bolt; it was too bright to make a distinction.  I judged the size to be several feet in thickness; they appeared fuzzy, but quite distinct; again, it was too bright to distinguish if there were small spikes or simply a brightness gradient .  The balls appeared to persist for about a second or more, for as long as flashes recurred along the bolt, but this estimate could have been skewed by persistence of vision on my retinas.  My wife, also a physicist, witnessed the phenomenon as well.  As it was repeated frequently in this storm, I got my camera and discovered to my dismay that it was out of film.  I drove to a store and bought film, and then chased the storm northwards towards Cedar Rapids, but failed to catch the storm or photograph the phenomenon. I have not observed it in any other of the many storms I have seen in Iowa, Idaho, and elsewhere since, although I have been looking for it!  I have not encountered a plasma physics explanation, nor has my son (who was about 7 months old at the time and is now also a Ph.D. plasma physicist). I have described this as ""ball lightning"" because of its persistent nature and spatial coherence that implies some kind of temporary confinement.  My only other reference point is my aunt's description of a ""glowing ball"" that rolled out of her television console and across her living room, leaving burn marks on her carpet, when her TV antenna was hit by lightning in Pennsylvania in the 1950s.","Intense thunderstorm with many bolts repeated along the same paths to earth, observed at distances as close as half a mile, then moving away northward from observer; phenomenon repeated frequently during 20 minutes or more",Outdoors,1969 summer afternoon  ,,"Iowa City, Iowa",You may publish my anonymized report,,,,,,

We had an old tube radio without a case - just a metal chassis.  I was looking at it to see if it might be safe to plug into the wall.  It was not - one of the two wires from the plug just ended in frayed copper.  While I was looking, my friend said, ""I know why it's not working!  It's not plugged in!"" and he plugged it into the wall.  Since this was not safe, I dropped the radio in surprise onto a non-metallic desk.  It fell about a foot.  As it fell, the bare wire from the AC cord brushed against the chassis and made a spark.  Out of that spark popped a sphere of ball lightning!  It floated towards the floor silently.  It fell slower than the rate at which a bubble falls.  I thought it looked beautiful and I wanted to touch it, but since its origin was electrical I thought it might hurt me so I didn't.  (I wish I had so I could have learned more.)  When it touched the floor, which was varnished wood, it looked like it got sucked into the floor and disappeared silently.  It left a charred spot on the floor.
Later, as an engineering student at MIT, I tired to recreate the event, but I was unsuccessful.  The radio was probably the typical AC/DC tube design of the 1950's.  The chassis might have been steel coated in zinc or cadmium, and might also have been dusty.  This schematic is similar:

I never had the impression that it was paranormal at all. We had so many loud and scary storms in that home that I knew it had to be something to do with the storm.

I wanted to put my hand through the sphere but at the last moment I backed away. As I did so, the ball came at me suddenly and I stumbled back as fast as I could. The ball stopped suddenly, hovered for a few seconds and then it was gone. Just like that, it just vanished into thin air as if the night ate it. No sparks, no hissing, no sign it was ever there.

The event occurred at about 6.30am in July or August 1973. I was among a group of archaeologists billeted in a Village Hall in the village of West Stafford, near Dorchester, Dorset, England. About twenty of us were sleeping on mattresses on the floor of the building and had been woken by a succession of intense thunderstorms that had rumbled on and on, getting close and then fading, only then to start up again. Most of us were therefore wide-wake, sitting up and talking.
The ball-lightning event began when the girl opposite me looked broadly in my direction and screamed. My floor mattress was located immediately beneath a closed glazed window, single-glazed and with old iron window frame. The scream prompted me to look up, and three or four feet above my head was a glowing ball, and it appeared to have travelled through the glass. It was no larger than an orange, was yellow-white in colour, and moved horizontally into the hall before rising up into the wooden roof beams where it discharged - exploded is probably putting it too strongly - with a crackle that reminded me of the noise the old flash-bulbs used to make.
And that's all there is to tell. We'd all seen it, and talked about it for days, though at the time none of us knew what we'd seen and I think I only found out about ball-lightning some years later, which is why I've never got round to recording it. I have no idea if any of the others present that day have ever recorded the event and I'm no longer in touch with any of them.
I remember immediately after the event getting up, and going outside, to check both sides of the window-frame (which is how I recall its construction), thinking that I might find burn-marks or such like. But there was nothing, nor do I recall there being any smell associated with the ball or its eventual disappearance.
I would estimate that the ball of lightning lasted no more than 4 or 5 seconds, and the distance travelled was probably no more than 5 metres.",,,,,,You may publish my anonymized report,,,,,,

Heard about you on BBC Radio 4 ‘Inside Science’ just now.

Lifelong amateur interest in meteorology, since tending the school Stevenson screen.

I well remember the August 6 1981 ‘day turned to night’ storm well. MCS? 60k’ cloud tops.

Was working, somewhat distractedly, on the 14th floor of this tower block:

(51.3758471, -0.0964670)

Probably around, or just after midday, I observed a pinpoint of bright light drifting slowly over the lower rise buildings here:

(51.3730407, -0.0993310)

I can’t state a duration but recall some diminution it, hence loss of interest.

Nor can I discount the possibility of it being a child’s foil balloon (hardly a day for a trip to town or party though). Not that these were commonplace in the early 80s, although references suggest development in the 70s:

There was a set of external double doors at either end (both sets were closed at the time).  The corridor was about 3 metres wide and had a set of 3 steps one third of the way along.  I was walking down the steps on the right side of the corridor holding an empty tray under my arm (with about 30 metres in front of me).  As I descended the steps, a ball of lightening appeared from behind me and travelled horizontally swiftly down the the left side of the corridor and seemed to explode at the end of the corridor.

But listening to your piece on the 'Inside Science' programme, it can travel through glass. Lightning always terrified my mum. As soon as there was a lightning storm brewing, she would remove the TV aerial cable, open the transom windows then sit on the stairs, shaking with fear.

They both had fuzzy edges and emitting a green/white light (it seemed white in the centre and green on the outside). Both balls flew over the top of my next door neighbours house, both, I would say, on pretty much the same trajectory. I would say they were about 50 feet in the air and both travelled in a straight line before simply disappearing in around the same location. Speed wise they weren't terribly fast, if I had to guess, I'd say anywhere between 15-25mph. I saw the first one just with sheer luck, after that I kept an eye out to see if I could see anymore and sure enough, within 5-10 minutes I saw the other one. As both the balls came from behind my property, I checked the fields behind me and I couldn't make out anyone, to me ruling out potential of fireworks. They struck me as not being fireworks anyway, simply because the behaviour of the balls wasn't like that of erratic fireworks. I posted a status on to a local Facebook group asking if anyone else had seen the lights, a little later I received a private message from someone in a neighbouring village who's grandchild had just seen a ball of light enter the living room via a window and then hit a wall and disappeared.

A lightening strike about 200m in front of me produced a ball at the point of impact.  It lasted only momentarily.  I quote from my diary which I wrote up that evening.  I describe the ascent from Panticosa:

""The next stage started with a long uphill plod.  When getting well up the skies darkened and  thunder started.  I sought sanctuary at the base of some small cliffs. There was a lot of lightening and thunder.  I watched lightening strike hillsides opposite and to the right, 4-5 seconds away.  I waited for te skies to clear as I could see distant hills in sunshine, but it was slow.  The nearest strike was about 1 second away, right in front of me on a small ridge.  At the point of contact it seemed that there was a small ball of lightening perhaps 2 ft diameter.  A couple of minues later there was a strange smell of the lightening. I sat in my shorts and goretex jacket and waited.  Then the rain became hail, up to 10mm diameter, which stung when it hit.  Finally it stopped and I continued ...""

8/14/2021 11:02:15,,,Less than a second,,,,"It was Wednesday July 28th 2021 and the time was approximately 13:50 -13:55 pm. I was sitting on my sofa at house number 54 Belle Vue Avenue, Scholes. Postcode LS15 4AE.   Which is in a small village on the eastern edge of the City of Leeds  
West Yorkshire, England .
 GPS 53°49'40.3""N 1°25'30.0""W  My house sits behind agricultural fields which look across to the next village and more agricultural fields.
 I was messaging on my smart phone with my granddaughter. There was a bad thunder storm and heavy rain that had been rumbling around for about thirty minutes and was very noisy . It got very dark and all of a sudden an almighty crack of lightening which lit up both windows in the room and made me jump forwards off the sofa. The movement felt involuntary.
I was looking at my arms as it felt as though the hairs on my arms were stood up on end ...I didn't realise I had so much hair on my arms. I immediately felt as though I was in a bright glass tank with both windows around me. I ran into the kitchen where the electric  box is as I felt that the house had been struck by lightening but the clock on the cooker was still working and the electric light switches were OK too. I felt very frightened and was convinced something must have been struck by lightening. I ran back into the room and looked out of the window facing onto the street looking across to other houses. I suddenly realised how quiet and still it was outside. It didn't look as though anything had been struck. I opened the outside door to see if I could smell fire or smoke but everything seemed OK. I calmed myself down and and finished texting my granddaughter and the message was sent at 13:59. My husband returned home 30 minutes later when he realised that our SKY TV was not working...we could see the Internet and WiFi were working and when I phoned the Sky TV company they said maybe the storm had affected the SKY dish on the roof of the house and had gone straight to the Sky box in the room and cut out transmission.
My neighbour directly opposite said she too was brought to her feet after the loud crack of lightening and she went straight to her window and could see a red ball of fire hovering waist high above the road between her house and mine..she said it was there for about 10 seconds and then it just dissipated  and was gone. She said she couldn't stop looking across to our house as she was looking for smoke as she was sure something would have got on fire..she even went to open the door to see if she could smell fire . She thought I had gone out with my husband and when she heard I had been in the house on my own at the time she was very worried if I was OK .
Then the days after the storm we realised by chatting to neighbours that my neighbour whose house is joined onto mine was empty when the storm was there but they came home to find their SKY Internet router was damaged too. But the house next to their house which is detached had been hit on the apex of the roof by lightening causing damage to the tiles on the roof and damage to the plaster on the walls of the room below. Also the house across the road from the house that had been damaged had their Internet router damaged too. Also another house opposite to my house which is joined onto the house where the lady opposite me saw the fireball also saw the fireball with her two small children who were also very frightened.

It was early 80’s.  We lived in the Head-teacher’s house in a residential school in Knowle, Solihull, West Midlands. 
We were watching television one evening (pro0bably Autumn because it was dark outside).  Suddenly there was a very loud explosion and the lights and TV went out.  I thought a plane had crashed. We rushed out to the hall and found that the windows on the front of the house had been smashed. BUT THE EXTRAORDINARY THING WAS THAT THE GLASS HAD ALL FALLEN OUTSIDE 
Later it was found that throughout the school and other employees houses a lot of electric appliances and telephones were damaged.  A large Oak tree in an adjoining field had been “struck”.  In fact it seemed to have IMPLODED: there were strange shaped bits of tree scattered about. You could see the cell structure of the wood, I had never seen anything like it. Only about a third of the tree remained.   Witnesses resident in the school said they had seen a “light” travel from the direction of the tree towards the collection of building and our house.
There was no thunder or lightening or rain following this event.
This was reported in the local paper: either the Solihull Times or the Solihull Observer or both.

We do have power lines but where the ball lightning occurred was over 100' from the power lines. I am writing to let you know that Sunday, August 15th, 2021 in Greensboro, NC in my backyard my granddaughter and I saw a lightning ball.  It was close to 5:00pm.  It happened before a storm came.  It was a little bigger than the size of a beach ball.  It was brilliant white and lasted about 10seconds and then exploded with a very loud boom.  It sounded like an explosion or a bomb going off.  It was off the ground approximately 8ft and there were leaves above the lightening ball that were swirling wildly above it.  When the lightening ball exploded there was a debris like dust and the leaves dropped.  There were no burn marks, smoldering, or any marks on the ground, nor could the leaves be identified as burned and no smell of fire.  The next door neighbors saw a bright light, not the ball, but heard the loud explosion sound.  My husband also saw a brilliant light, not the ball and heard the sound.  The neighbors came out and asked if we were okay.  I have never seen anything like this and have never heard of ball lightning before I actually saw this lightning ball.  It still baffles my granddaughter and me as to what we saw.  Thought I would let you know since I was researching what we could have witnessed and came across your article.  This is all new to me.  Also, wanted to let you know if possibly there is some type of a pattern that ball lightning follows (ie other states, or possibly different cities on August 15th 2021.

We were eating our meal but the restaurant became flooded and we made a run for it.
The whole harbour was flooded and the thunder and lightening went on for half an hour at least.

The world turned into a flash of blue light!   I swore I saw a blue flash, an  exploding blue ball with white lightning shooting through it!  It seemed to hover, still for a couple seconds.

There were a few loud cracks of lightning but no rain yet.  I did not see the BL enter the basement….however, I believe it was the funny smell that caught my attention first. When I looked up I saw a ball of light moving in the hallway. It was about 70’ away, and I was confused about what I was seeing and I stood up and walked into the basement hallway to get a better look.  As I realized the BL was moving toward me and that what I was seeing was not “normal” I got back on the stairs and peeked at it as it got closer.

The adults were all talking. I was 10 and just sitting silently and listening. The room had two large windows facing the street. It had gotten pretty dark in the room as the weather got worse. Suddenly a fireball came thru the window. It came thru it as if it wasn't there. As I said it was white and about the size of a volleyball. It was probably about 7 to 8 feet from the floor and came thru like a comet and went thru the room in front of everyone and went out of the room. There was a hallway and it came thru the room and went down the hallway. I was sitting where I could not see it after it left the living room. I could not see down that hallway. There was a hush in the room and gasps from the women and then.. after a minute or two they all went back to talking. I was stunned and could not believe what I had just seen. I got up and went to that hallway to see where it would have gone. The hallway went to the kitchen and there was a kitchen sink straight down the hall in the path.

Irregular in shape.  Judy and I both witnessed a most unusual phenomenon one stormy, day roughly forty years ago as we were in the car heading southbound on South Cobb Drive in Smyrna, Georgia.  Unless you believe in ghosts, apparitions, or aliens from another world, what we observed in just a few moments can only be explained as ‘ball lightning’.  There can be no other narrative.
We had just passed the intersection of Wisteria Lane and McCauley Road and out of nowhere this bright pulsating orb crossed the road just ahead of us on virtually a level horizontal path, moving left to right (east to west) some fifty to seventy-five feet off the ground.  I would estimate it was about the size of a basketball or beach ball.  Not knowing what it was, we were both silent for a few minutes as we gathered our thoughts and tried to process what we had just witnessed.
With a little research (this preceded Google and instant searches on the internet) we determined that it could only be ‘ball lightning’.  Believe it or not, scientific data on ball lightning is scarce.  In fact, while you can find photographs, there is no quantifiable data and no scientific explanations for its occurrence.  There are only reports of public sightings (and a few pictures) which provide scientists with mostly inconsistent descriptions.  Because of the lack of reproducible data, the world of physical science proclaims the existence of ball lightning an unproven physical phenomenon.  I will tell you or you can ask Judy.  We saw it.  It does exist!

It came out the chimney, into the living room, no more than 6-8 feet away from me (as well as 2 friends also there), where it hovered for a few seconds at eye level (I was sitting on the couch). It then casually floated across the living room, through the dining room & into the kitchen.

I was unable to see it exit, but it was seen by someone else (making them the 4th person to witness this event) who was in the kitchen at the time. It floated right past her, a mere few feet away.
I recall that as the ball floated along, it seemed to bob up & down slightly (resembling a low amplitude wavelength pattern).
It did not make contact with anything & left no damage or evidence that it even existed. It appeared to move in a path that was oddly specific, as though it was purposely avoiding contact with walls/objects & seemingly attracted to the only open door which lead back outside & even turning a 90° corner, to get to it.","It occurred during a thunderstorm.

I stopped just as the light came into the open area where trees were cleared on either side of the road. It crossed the road about 20 feet in front of where I stopped, moving from north to south, keeping a constant height despite passing over rough ground, and borrow pits on either side of the raised road surface. 

I watched the light continue into the forest on the south side of the road. The ball of light faded away, disappearing about 20-30 yards past the road. It maintained a very consistent path and height the entire time I watched.

It was a summer's day in the south of France, in or around Juans-les-Pins near Antibes on a family holiday when I was 8-10 years old; I recollect my brother being with me, and since he is 3 years younger than I am, I couldn't imagine having taken a 4 year old with me, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't 11. To be explicit the year must have been around 1969-71. [Juan-les-Pins looks rather more developed according to Google Earth than I remember it, but this memory is now at least 36 years old, so no surprise perhaps!]

Anyway, there was a thunderstorm and suddenly out of the base of the cloud in front of us three equally spaced dots of light appeared and proceeded to travel in a straight, silent line towards the ground where they disappeared equally silently. Which is not to say they were absolutely silent because it was hard to tell how far away they were, and of course the rain itself was making some noise.

To see one ball of lightning is a once-in-a-lifetime event - to see three at once was (in mature retrospect) absolutely stunning; (my maternal grandmother said she had seen ball lightning - and she also said she saw ""The Great Comet"" ""of 1908"" - having specifically said she didn't remember Halley's Comet in 1910; I wonder if she saw Comet Morehouse, which had unusual tail structure - see also here.)

I have always wondered about their spacing and trajectory, particularly whether they were following the Earth's magnetic field; I (hazily) recollect the angle to the ground as being about 60 degrees but have never bothered to check the dip in the south of France. Nothing more to say really except that that they appeared as small dots (though not quite pinpoints of light) and not balls - I guess they were too far away.

Pity I didn't have a camera with me, but I would probably have missed the moment - they didn't take more than a second or so to travel from [low, qualification added 2021] cloud base to ground.

The only specific conclusion I can draw from this is that the theory that says ball lightning results from a normal lightning strike on highly silicaceous soil is at best incomplete","Summer, nearby thunderstorm starting/in progress",Outdoors,Unknown,,"Juan-les-Pins, near Antibes, South of France",You may publish my anonymized report,,,,,,

The only way i can describe it that it was as big as 4ft maybe 6ft . I lived on the 7th floor in San Francisco i think it was in march 2013 at the pier hotel. The big light was coming twords me then it went left as to go past the building on my left.  So i turned around for a second and when i looked back out of the window the big round light came into my apartment. I had taken a picture with my phone at the moment the light entered my apartment and what the picture showed was a bright big light around me. I did not feel nothing but i felt something . I since then lost that phone. . But i promise i seen a big orb and it made a left then came into my apartment and theough my body. I felt different.

It came through my window and a light shined all around me as if a bright light was pointed at me.,So I was on the 7th floor so how ever the seventh floor is at the Pier Hotel in San Francisco that's how high it was in the sky.

The weather is usually in the 60s it was a clear night. No clouds in the sky. I lived where all around me was buildings. When the orb turned left it was as it went away. Then I turned for a second and looked back out the window and it was coming twords me then in through me. It was amazing feeling.,There was no rain it couldn't have been a power line.

(Your observations even w/o other evidence are EXTREMELY USEFUL!),30 seconds to a minute,white light with silver blinding light,A bit larger than a basketball,"Sound of quick electric snapping very distinct. It was not buzzing, just sharp snaps one after the other, no odor, no heat, it did not connect to anything ","Pure White light with silvery white sparks, I heard the extremely Loud Crack of lightning and saw the ball hovering about 6 feet in the air at the entrance to my hallway. I was in the kitchen about 30 feet away. After it disappeared an extremely loud clap of Thunder occured. The thunder was about 3 minutes after the ball appeared. The time frame made the Thunder seem not connected with the lightning ball. After it was gone I continued to hear the snaps in my house for a few seconds. I thought my electrical supply was damaged. My friends heard the thunder at the barn 1 mile from the house. It was so loud they said they were worried and they saw when the bolt struck near my house. They witnessed a second strike as well closer to the barn and the same unusually loud thunder. I checked my house, and looked at the transformer from the window. All my electrical appliances worked and my TV which was close to the ball did not have any damage. I have no known electrical problems at this time from the incident. There are no visible burn marks or other evidence. All the doors to the hallway were closed. ","We had a forcast for heavy Precipitation with an occasional thunderstorm and minimal risk for tornado development. It was 56 degrees with precipitation all day. It was not raining hard at the time the lighting hit and there were only two strikes of lighting all day. The one that produced the ball and then another loud bolt that followed. No lightening/thunder before or after those 2 strange strikes, about 2 to 3 minutes apart. They were unusual, the neighbors and friends talked about the deafening sound of the thunder. It was incredibly loud unlike normal Thunder and only 2 strikes in the entire day and the 2 strikes were from the same conditions close in time.","I live in a Rural area on a cattle ranch. I have underground utilities to the house but there is a transformer outside on a pole. There are no towers near the farm. The farm is rolling hills.There is a fast moving stream running past the house and through the entire farm with small waterfalls and rock formation areas. I did not see the first strike but my friends said they saw it go down near my house and the second strike they saw was at the bottom of my land near the stream. As I answered above, the lighting ball was in my house about 6 feet off the ground hovering in the air at the entrance to my hallway. The snapping sound of electrical snaps is the only way I know to describe how it sounds. I went online to find those sounds to help describe it but could not find the same sound. It is a loud, distinct SNAP, quick and clean sound. It scared me. I am trying hard to think of what it looked like and I thought of sparklers you light. The silver white sparks extending out from the ball looked like the tips of the sparklers and they were small and connected to the ball, like a sparkler extends the light out and it drops to the ground the ball sparkler tips stayed close with the ball and never dropped away or separated.",1/9/2022 around 9:55 in the morning.
