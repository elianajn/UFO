It stayed a constant size, shape and color throughout.",I was inside a vehicle (windows very slightly open) and did not notice any smell or change in temperature. It was perfectly silent. I remember noting an absence of sound in the area (no insects or birds) during the encounter.,"I saw ball lightning for the one and only time when I was about 8 years old, in 1990 or 1991. This was on the outskirts of Tucson, AZ near the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains. It was about 8 or 9 pm at night, and we were driving back to my grandmother’s house. The weather had been cloudy and overcast all day, as happens when the remnants of a hurricane or tropical storm moves in from the gulf. It might have rained earlier in the day, but it was not raining or storming at the time.
As we pulled into the driveway and parked, a giant red ball emerged from the cloud cover in front of us. It was red and seemed to be covered in flames. (With the perspective of an adult, I think we were too far away to see any normal looking flames, and the ripples on the surface might have been more like some kind of electrical fire or disturbance. It looked almost exactly like how medieval woodcuts depict fireballs or comets, though I had not seen these kinds of pictures at that age).
The ball was perfectly round, monochromatic red, and lit the entire desert around us red as well. It emerged from the clouds without disturbing them, dipped down and over, and then went back up into the clouds, exactly like a giant yo-yo with a slight sideways trajectory. It lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. The whole episode was silent, and the desert was eerily quite for the entire time, without the usual bird or insect noises.
Although I remember the episode very clearly, I never spoke of it, and for years I sometimes even wondered if I dreamed it. One day about a decade after the event, my mother (who was driving the car that night) mentioned that she had once seen a UFO, and described the events almost exactly as I remember them! I have since concluded that ball lightning is the most likely explanation for what I saw. 
","There was light, even cloud cover from horizon to horizon. It had been cloudy all day. This weather pattern happen sometimes in the Tucson area when a hurricane or tropical storm moves in from the gulf, but has no real storm energy left when it crosses the Sonoran Desert. It was not storming at the time, and I don't recall any thunder or lightning that day.","This occurred outdoors. We lived at the edge of Tucson near the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The ball emerged over the desert, between our house and the mountains, which was almost completely undeveloped at the time, with no tall structures or power lines.

It was approximately the size of a tennis ball, maybe a bit smaller.","I believe it made a hissing, sizzling noise.","We were in a kitchen, which had a disused but open fireplace adjacent to an aluminum-trim table and an open door leading to an outside porch. A lighting arrestor cable was run down the chimney and bolted to a steel pipe driven through the ground under the fireplace. The table was an old 1940’s four seat Formica table with wide aluminum grooved siding (about the width of a palm) extending down from the table top.There was a very close lightning hit and everyone was startled, stopped talking and then laughed. As we did that, a hissing green ball descended the lightning arrestor cable (about 3 feet of it was in view), hopped over to the aluminum table edging (about 3-4 feet), circled the table counter-clockwise 3/4 of a circuit until it was opposite the screen door about 6 feet from the table. It left the table trim and traveled in a downward arc from the table height to about knee level, where it passed through the door screen (steel, I think, but maybe vinyl). It bounced once or twice as it moved off the painted concrete porch, then popped out of existence with a flash but without sound. The entire interior part of the encounter took about 3 seconds, enough time for the people in the room to freeze but not enough time to react before it was gone. I recall that it melted about a one-inch hole in the screen in the door, but left no marks on anything else.It was green with a very bright center and fuzzy edges that fluctuated like a three dimensional oscilloscope trace.","This was in mid-late June in a rural area of Maryland around 1970 or 1971.

I was in my apartment (Carmel Apartments) on the second floor that faced East when to my stunned observation this spinning round white bolt came silently through the closed Eastern sliding glass door. The rooms were in the shape of a “T”. The living room/dining room were bound by sliding glass doors on each side. The shortened upright of the “T” led to the front door with a window beside it. This phenomenon appeared suddenly inside. I did not see its approach. Upon observation I ascertained it as some sort of ungrounded lightening, so being afraid of being the conduit to it being grounded I backed up and flattened against the wall. I expected the ball to continue through to the dining room sliding door to exit but it seemed to be drawn towards me(which was frightening). It moved steadily toward me making its interior path an “L” instead of the straight line I expected and exited after passing very close but not touching in front of me at chest height. I didn’t feel it passing. Keeping its form, it passed through the closed front door South facing window. I was too stunned to watch it further.
     The apartment house was about 75 feet west from a utility pole upon which hung a (?) transformer box. My kids and I often observed “lightening” dancing along the wires during a storm. I thought this lightening had “escaped” from the wire.

I am 64 yrs. old and I saw ball lightning when I was a kid. I was about 8 yrs. old. I lived in Clawson a suburb of Detroit on the west side.

I was board and setting in my room on the second story of our home looking out at the loudest and heaviest rain I had ever seen. I don't remember lightening, just a serious downpour of water. I saw something bright like the sun a little smaller than a basket ball fall from the branches of the front yard tree onto a branch that I used to dangle from. It was about 5 to 8 yards from the front of our house, (city houses close to the road, the tree was against the sidewalk at the end of our lawn). This ball rolled a couple inches down the branch and another the same size fell in behind the other. The balls never touched. They were slightly jiggly like a burning candle flame when it flicks from a breeze. The first ball rolled down the side of the tree trunk onto the road and the second rolled in its place but before it left the branch a small sun smaller than a tennis ball bounced from the limbs of the tree onto the same branch. ( I cannot say what kind of tree or if there were scorch marks anywhere. I don't remember looking and no one ever said). The small sun was very bouncy (up and down, not side to side) like a child vs an adult. The second sun rolled to the road. the two large suns were rolling down the edge of our fairly newly paved (from dirt to concrete) road where most of the water was concentrated. I remember looking back from the small to the large suns a few times when finally the small sun bounced to the ground and followed the larger two. All three suns, the larger two rolling smoothly and the smaller a little bouncy rolled out of sight down the street as far as I could see from my upstairs window. This could not have lasted more than 10 seconds total. From my upstairs view I could only see the tree trunk and the lowest branches of the tree. I knew no one would ever believe me.

It was an excellent vantage point that was often up close and personal with the frequent Iowa thunderstorms. One particular storm had my full attention: there were many lighting strikes to earth, with unusually frequent multiple flashes along the same path.  What riveted my attention was the presence of what appeared to be twin balls on either side of some of the bolts, recurring about every 40 feet along its length.  It's possible these pairs were actually a single toroid around the bolt; it was too bright to make a distinction.  I judged the size to be several feet in thickness; they appeared fuzzy, but quite distinct; again, it was too bright to distinguish if there were small spikes or simply a brightness gradient .  The balls appeared to persist for about a second or more, for as long as flashes recurred along the bolt, but this estimate could have been skewed by persistence of vision on my retinas.  My wife, also a physicist, witnessed the phenomenon as well.  As it was repeated frequently in this storm, I got my camera and discovered to my dismay that it was out of film.  I drove to a store and bought film, and then chased the storm northwards towards Cedar Rapids, but failed to catch the storm or photograph the phenomenon. I have not observed it in any other of the many storms I have seen in Iowa, Idaho, and elsewhere since, although I have been looking for it!  I have not encountered a plasma physics explanation, nor has my son (who was about 7 months old at the time and is now also a Ph.D. plasma physicist). I have described this as ""ball lightning"" because of its persistent nature and spatial coherence that implies some kind of temporary confinement.  My only other reference point is my aunt's description of a ""glowing ball"" that rolled out of her television console and across her living room, leaving burn marks on her carpet, when her TV antenna was hit by lightning in Pennsylvania in the 1950s.","Intense thunderstorm with many bolts repeated along the same paths to earth, observed at distances as close as half a mile, then moving away northward from observer; phenomenon repeated frequently during 20 minutes or more",Outdoors,1969 summer afternoon  ,,,"Iowa City, Iowa",,,,You may publish my anonymized report,,

We had an old tube radio without a case - just a metal chassis.  I was looking at it to see if it might be safe to plug into the wall.  It was not - one of the two wires from the plug just ended in frayed copper.  While I was looking, my friend said, ""I know why it's not working!  It's not plugged in!"" and he plugged it into the wall.  Since this was not safe, I dropped the radio in surprise onto a non-metallic desk.  It fell about a foot.  As it fell, the bare wire from the AC cord brushed against the chassis and made a spark.  Out of that spark popped a sphere of ball lightning!  It floated towards the floor silently.  It fell slower than the rate at which a bubble falls.  I thought it looked beautiful and I wanted to touch it, but since its origin was electrical I thought it might hurt me so I didn't.  (I wish I had so I could have learned more.)  When it touched the floor, which was varnished wood, it looked like it got sucked into the floor and disappeared silently.  It left a charred spot on the floor.
Later, as an engineering student at MIT, I tired to recreate the event, but I was unsuccessful.  The radio was probably the typical AC/DC tube design of the 1950's.  The chassis might have been steel coated in zinc or cadmium, and might also have been dusty.  This schematic is similar:

My room is a square with windows (glass louvres) taking up one wall. I awoke to the sound of buzzing and jumped out of bed when I saw the ball hovering close to the window. I almost felt that it was watching me. It moved towards the right (about 4 feet above the floor) and did a circle around the room. All the time it buzzed. Its movement bobbed a little, like a bee over a flower. I had 2 single beds in my room, the left one closer to the window and I slept on the other. There's a space of approx 2 metres between them. The ball came back around between the foot of the beds (closer to the wall than to the foot of the beds) and just hovered there. I decided to get closer and stopped about a foot away from it. I had a really good look at it and was surprised there was no heat. And then I saw that it was hollow inside and there was something tiny glowing inside. I can't remember too much detail here except for my own actions. I'm not even sure what colour the internal glow was but I don't think it was the same white and blue hues. It was a warmer colour. I wanted to put my hand through the sphere but at the last moment I backed away. As I did so, the ball came at me suddenly and I stumbled back as fast as I could. The ball stopped suddenly, hovered for a few seconds and then it was gone. Just like that, it just vanished into thin air as if the night ate it. No sparks, no hissing, no sign it was ever there.   ","Weather is always hot where I'm from. No rain or storm. But I think the location could be of benefit to you. There are mountains behind the house and you can see them through the bedroom window.

The event occurred at about 6.30am in July or August 1973. I was among a group of archaeologists billeted in a Village Hall in the village of West Stafford, near Dorchester, Dorset, England. About twenty of us were sleeping on mattresses on the floor of the building and had been woken by a succession of intense thunderstorms that had rumbled on and on, getting close and then fading, only then to start up again. Most of us were therefore wide-wake, sitting up and talking.
The ball-lightning event began when the girl opposite me looked broadly in my direction and screamed. My floor mattress was located immediately beneath a closed glazed window, single-glazed and with old iron window frame. The scream prompted me to look up, and three or four feet above my head was a glowing ball, and it appeared to have travelled through the glass. It was no larger than an orange, was yellow-white in colour, and moved horizontally into the hall before rising up into the wooden roof beams where it discharged - exploded is probably putting it too strongly - with a crackle that reminded me of the noise the old flash-bulbs used to make.
And that's all there is to tell. We'd all seen it, and talked about it for days, though at the time none of us knew what we'd seen and I think I only found out about ball-lightning some years later, which is why I've never got round to recording it. I have no idea if any of the others present that day have ever recorded the event and I'm no longer in touch with any of them.
I remember immediately after the event getting up, and going outside, to check both sides of the window-frame (which is how I recall its construction), thinking that I might find burn-marks or such like. But there was nothing, nor do I recall there being any smell associated with the ball or its eventual disappearance.

I saw a bright blue ball with soft edges, I felt as if it was alive. My son was in the room with me and we stood very still in the middle of the room to get out of its way as the ball was moving around the edges of the room. I thought it would injure us if it touched us. The ball travelled around the sides of the room before going out through the large window from the same direction it had come from, it then disappeared and I couldn't see it anywhere in the garden. It was moving at a constant speed at about 4 feet off the ground. While the ball was travelling around the room it passed over a Fax machine and telephone  - neither ever worked again and we had to replace them. ",The sky was very dark and I could hear thunder and see lighting. It wasn't particularly cold.,"It happened indoors in our home. We live on the outskirts of Cardiff, Wales. Our house backs onto fields, there are some trees behind our house and beyond that is a reservoir. There are no power lines overhead and the only structure we had at the time was a small shed in our garden that was close to the back of the house.

It was like it just came out of a hole in the sky. It then faded in intensity but remained quite bright. It appeared on my right and travelled to my left, falling slowly and travelling approximately 50m. It moved strangely, like it was bouncing down an invisible hill or it was suspended on a piece of elastic. All the while, small bright particles of light fizzed from it and fell towards the ground apparently affected quite strongly by gravity. Viewed from above, I imagine it followed a straight course. Halfway through its journey it disappeared through the corner of the building opposite my position. It made no fuss as it passed through a brick wall. At the time I thought that was the end of my private fire work display but very quickly a light appeared in the window in the other side of the corner of the building. The ball came right out through the glass of the closed window (It also passed through the net curtains without any visible damage.) and continued its bouncy journey towards the ground in my garden. Just before it reached the ground it exploded . It didn’t explode with a bang, it just fizzed slightly louder. Four or five large pieces and many small bright particles shot out in all directions. The explosion was approximately 10m wide with all of the particles being affected by gravity. Some of the larger ones bounced on the group before disappearing.",It was late summer and quite warm and humid. The sky was full cloud cover with no rain. There was no thunder or lightning. The reason I was looking out of my window in the first place was because the light had changed suddenly outside. There was a green cast to everything. The sky was green. It was really quite eerie.

Heard about you on BBC Radio 4 ‘Inside Science’ just now.

Lifelong amateur interest in meteorology, since tending the school Stevenson screen.

I well remember the August 6 1981 ‘day turned to night’ storm well. MCS? 60k’ cloud tops.

Was working, somewhat distractedly, on the 14th floor of this tower block:

(51.3758471, -0.0964670)

Probably around, or just after midday, I observed a pinpoint of bright light drifting slowly over the lower rise buildings here:

(51.3730407, -0.0993310)

I can’t state a duration but recall some diminution it, hence loss of interest.

Nor can I discount the possibility of it being a child’s foil balloon (hardly a day for a trip to town or party though). Not that these were commonplace in the early 80s, although references suggest development in the 70s:

I was a novice in a convent, which had a long corridor (40 - 50 metres long) running the length of the building. There was a set of external double doors at either end (both sets were closed at the time).  The corridor was about 3 metres wide and had a set of 3 steps one third of the way along.  I was walking down the steps on the right side of the corridor holding an empty tray under my arm (with about 30 metres in front of me).  As I descended the steps, a ball of lightening appeared from behind me and travelled horizontally swiftly down the the left side of the corridor and seemed to explode at the end of the corridor.

But listening to your piece on the 'Inside Science' programme, it can travel through glass. Lightning always terrified my mum.

I would say they were about 50 feet in the air and both travelled in a straight line before simply disappearing in around the same location.

I saw the first one just with sheer luck, after that I kept an eye out to see if I could see anymore and sure enough, within 5-10 minutes I saw the other one. As both the balls came from behind my property, I checked the fields behind me and I couldn't make out anyone, to me ruling out potential of fireworks. They struck me as not being fireworks anyway, simply because the behaviour of the balls wasn't like that of erratic fireworks.

I describe the ascent from Panticosa:

""The next stage started with a long uphill plod.  When getting well up the skies darkened and  thunder started.  I sought sanctuary at the base of some small cliffs. There was a lot of lightening and thunder.  I watched lightening strike hillsides opposite and to the right, 4-5 seconds away.  I waited for te skies to clear as I could see distant hills in sunshine, but it was slow.  The nearest strike was about 1 second away, right in front of me on a small ridge.  At the point of contact it seemed that there was a small ball of lightening perhaps 2 ft diameter.  A couple of minues later there was a strange smell of the lightening.

8/14/21 11:02,,,Less than a second,,,,"It was Wednesday July 28th 2021 and the time was approximately 13:50 -13:55 pm. I was sitting on my sofa at house number 54 Belle Vue Avenue, Scholes. Postcode LS15 4AE.   Which is in a small village on the eastern edge of the City of Leeds  
West Yorkshire, England .
 GPS 53°49'40.3""N 1°25'30.0""W  My house sits behind agricultural fields which look across to the next village and more agricultural fields.
 I was messaging on my smart phone with my granddaughter. There was a bad thunder storm and heavy rain that had been rumbling around for about thirty minutes and was very noisy . It got very dark and all of a sudden an almighty crack of lightening which lit up both windows in the room and made me jump forwards off the sofa. The movement felt involuntary.
I was looking at my arms as it felt as though the hairs on my arms were stood up on end ...I didn't realise I had so much hair on my arms. I immediately felt as though I was in a bright glass tank with both windows around me. I ran into the kitchen where the electric  box is as I felt that the house had been struck by lightening but the clock on the cooker was still working and the electric light switches were OK too. I felt very frightened and was convinced something must have been struck by lightening. I ran back into the room and looked out of the window facing onto the street looking across to other houses. I suddenly realised how quiet and still it was outside. It didn't look as though anything had been struck. I opened the outside door to see if I could smell fire or smoke but everything seemed OK. I calmed myself down and and finished texting my granddaughter and the message was sent at 13:59. My husband returned home 30 minutes later when he realised that our SKY TV was not working...we could see the Internet and WiFi were working and when I phoned the Sky TV company they said maybe the storm had affected the SKY dish on the roof of the house and had gone straight to the Sky box in the room and cut out transmission.
My neighbour directly opposite said she too was brought to her feet after the loud crack of lightening and she went straight to her window and could see a red ball of fire hovering waist high above the road between her house and mine..she said it was there for about 10 seconds and then it just dissipated  and was gone. She said she couldn't stop looking across to our house as she was looking for smoke as she was sure something would have got on fire..she even went to open the door to see if she could smell fire . She thought I had gone out with my husband and when she heard I had been in the house on my own at the time she was very worried if I was OK .
Then the days after the storm we realised by chatting to neighbours that my neighbour whose house is joined onto mine was empty when the storm was there but they came home to find their SKY Internet router was damaged too. But the house next to their house which is detached had been hit on the apex of the roof by lightening causing damage to the tiles on the roof and damage to the plaster on the walls of the room below. Also the house across the road from the house that had been damaged had their Internet router damaged too. Also another house opposite to my house which is joined onto the house where the lady opposite me saw the fireball also saw the fireball with her two small children who were also very frightened.

It was early 80’s.  We lived in the Head-teacher’s house in a residential school in Knowle, Solihull, West Midlands. 
We were watching television one evening (pro0bably Autumn because it was dark outside).  Suddenly there was a very loud explosion and the lights and TV went out.  I thought a plane had crashed. We rushed out to the hall and found that the windows on the front of the house had been smashed. BUT THE EXTRAORDINARY THING WAS THAT THE GLASS HAD ALL FALLEN OUTSIDE 
Later it was found that throughout the school and other employees houses a lot of electric appliances and telephones were damaged.  A large Oak tree in an adjoining field had been “struck”.  In fact it seemed to have IMPLODED: there were strange shaped bits of tree scattered about. You could see the cell structure of the wood, I had never seen anything like it. Only about a third of the tree remained.   Witnesses resident in the school said they had seen a “light” travel from the direction of the tree towards the collection of building and our house.
There was no thunder or lightening or rain following this event.
This was reported in the local paper: either the Solihull Times or the Solihull Observer or both.

There were no burn marks, smoldering, or any marks on the ground, nor could the leaves be identified as burned and no smell of fire.  The next door neighbors saw a bright light, not the ball, but heard the loud explosion sound.  My husband also saw a brilliant light, not the ball and heard the sound.  The neighbors came out and asked if we were okay.  I have never seen anything like this and have never heard of ball lightning before I actually saw this lightning ball.  It still baffles my granddaughter and me as to what we saw.  Thought I would let you know since I was researching what we could have witnessed and came across your article.  This is all new to me.  Also, wanted to let you know if possibly there is some type of a pattern that ball lightning follows (ie other states, or possibly different cities on August 15th 2021.  Hope this helps for any research.  Sincerely, Peggy Grimes Furr (5719 Wildberry Drive, Greensboro, NC  27409)

We were eating our meal but the restaurant became flooded and we made a run for it.
The whole harbour was flooded and the thunder and lightening went on for half an hour at least. It was a very dangerous experience as we felt that we might be dragged into the harbour as the land was flooded. We escaped by running through the flood water and we went up some steep steps to avoid the floods and passed many fire engines that were going to the rescue of the flooded houses and restaurants. Many chairs and boats were swept onto the land and some ended up in shop windows. All the drain covers came off the drains and there was a terrible smell. We had to wade through water that was a foot - two foot deep.
 We drove back to our apartment and sat on the balcony and then after perhaps half an hour the phenomenon occurred.

The world turned into a flash of blue light!   I swore I saw a blue flash, an  exploding blue ball with white lightning shooting through it!  It seemed to hover, still for a couple seconds.

There were a few loud cracks of lightning but no rain yet.  I did not see the BL enter the basement….however, I believe it was the funny smell that caught my attention first.

It was about 70’ away, and I was confused about what I was seeing and I stood up and walked into the basement hallway to get a better look.  As I realized the BL was moving toward me and that what I was seeing was not “normal” I got back on the stairs and peeked at it as it got closer.

Irregular in shape.  Judy and I both witnessed a most unusual phenomenon one stormy, day roughly forty years ago as we were in the car heading southbound on South Cobb Drive in Smyrna, Georgia.  Unless you believe in ghosts, apparitions, or aliens from another world, what we observed in just a few moments can only be explained as ‘ball lightning’.  There can be no other narrative.
We had just passed the intersection of Wisteria Lane and McCauley Road and out of nowhere this bright pulsating orb crossed the road just ahead of us on virtually a level horizontal path, moving left to right (east to west) some fifty to seventy-five feet off the ground.  I would estimate it was about the size of a basketball or beach ball.  Not knowing what it was, we were both silent for a few minutes as we gathered our thoughts and tried to process what we had just witnessed.
With a little research (this preceded Google and instant searches on the internet) we determined that it could only be ‘ball lightning’.  Believe it or not, scientific data on ball lightning is scarce.  In fact, while you can find photographs, there is no quantifiable data and no scientific explanations for its occurrence.  There are only reports of public sightings (and a few pictures) which provide scientists with mostly inconsistent descriptions.  Because of the lack of reproducible data, the world of physical science proclaims the existence of ball lightning an unproven physical phenomenon.  I will tell you or you can ask Judy.  We saw it.  It does exist!

About fifty feet out there stood an ornamental evergreen tree (a fir, or a pine) that was somewhere around twenty feet tall. Between that tree and where we stood were two parked cars, perpendicular to our line of site and off to the left. Suddenly that tree was struck by lightning. The tree was brilliantly lit up and the lighting ball was born. There was no thunder. It is possible that the ball appeared first at the base of the tree, but my impression was that it dropped out of the tree. Either way it made its entrance into the world moving, bouncing much as a beach ball would do if dropped from several feet up in the air.

I have never mentioned this to anyone because it was so strange.  We did have a heavy rainstorm that followed about thirty minutes later.  One of the trees in our yard was struck by lightening during the storm and partially blown from the ground.  The tree survived; however, the following year brought a strange surprise to the tree.  The leaves on the tree were each five times the normal size.  During the years that have followed, the size of the leaves have returned to normal.  This is a ghinko tree.",It was summer and the sky at the time was clear although you could hear the sound of thunder.  A heavy storm did follow approximately thirty minutes later.,The lightening remained outside of our sunroom.

I since then lost that phone. . But i promise i seen a big orb and it made a left then came into my apartment and theough my body. I felt different.

The weather is usually in the 60s it was a clear night. No clouds in the sky. I lived where all around me was buildings. When the orb turned left it was as it went away. Then I turned for a second and looked back out the window and it was coming twords me then in through me. It was amazing feeling.,There was no rain it couldn't have been a power line.

It came through the glass door and straight to me, not fast not fluttering around, just came straight to me and then seemed to drop as though it fell through the table then I assume it exploded because it “threw” me or knocked me out of my chair and I am not sure if it shocked my knee or if I hit my knee on the table as I fell back.","I don’t recall any noteworthy weather, it was winter in Cleveland Ohio.  1985-88 and it was evening","Solon/Aurora Rd.

(Your observations even w/o other evidence are EXTREMELY USEFUL!),30 seconds to a minute,white light with silver blinding light,A bit larger than a basketball,"Sound of quick electric snapping very distinct. It was not buzzing, just sharp snaps one after the other, no odor, no heat, it did not connect to anything ","Pure White light with silvery white sparks, I heard the extremely Loud Crack of lightning and saw the ball hovering about 6 feet in the air at the entrance to my hallway. I was in the kitchen about 30 feet away. After it disappeared an extremely loud clap of Thunder occured. The thunder was about 3 minutes after the ball appeared. The time frame made the Thunder seem not connected with the lightning ball. After it was gone I continued to hear the snaps in my house for a few seconds. I thought my electrical supply was damaged. My friends heard the thunder at the barn 1 mile from the house. It was so loud they said they were worried and they saw when the bolt struck near my house. They witnessed a second strike as well closer to the barn and the same unusually loud thunder. I checked my house, and looked at the transformer from the window. All my electrical appliances worked and my TV which was close to the ball did not have any damage. I have no known electrical problems at this time from the incident. There are no visible burn marks or other evidence. All the doors to the hallway were closed. ","We had a forcast for heavy Precipitation with an occasional thunderstorm and minimal risk for tornado development. It was 56 degrees with precipitation all day. It was not raining hard at the time the lighting hit and there were only two strikes of lighting all day. The one that produced the ball and then another loud bolt that followed. No lightening/thunder before or after those 2 strange strikes, about 2 to 3 minutes apart. They were unusual, the neighbors and friends talked about the deafening sound of the thunder. It was incredibly loud unlike normal Thunder and only 2 strikes in the entire day and the 2 strikes were from the same conditions close in time.","I live in a Rural area on a cattle ranch. I have underground utilities to the house but there is a transformer outside on a pole. There are no towers near the farm. The farm is rolling hills.There is a fast moving stream running past the house and through the entire farm with small waterfalls and rock formation areas. I did not see the first strike but my friends said they saw it go down near my house and the second strike they saw was at the bottom of my land near the stream. As I answered above, the lighting ball was in my house about 6 feet off the ground hovering in the air at the entrance to my hallway. The snapping sound of electrical snaps is the only way I know to describe how it sounds. I went online to find those sounds to help describe it but could not find the same sound. It is a loud, distinct SNAP, quick and clean sound. It scared me. I am trying hard to think of what it looked like and I thought of sparklers you light. The silver white sparks extending out from the ball looked like the tips of the sparklers and they were small and connected to the ball, like a sparkler extends the light out and it drops to the ground the ball sparkler tips stayed close with the ball and never dropped away or separated.",1/9/2022 around 9:55 in the morning.
